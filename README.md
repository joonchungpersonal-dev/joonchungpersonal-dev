# Hey, I'm Joon

Builder, tinkerer, and lifelong learner. By day I'm a researcher at the University of Miami — by night I build things that scratch my own itch.

## What I'm Working On

**[Council of Elders](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/council-of-elders)** — A personal AI advisory board of history's greatest minds. Ask Marcus Aurelius, Hypatia, or Rumi for advice. 101 elders spanning every inhabited continent and 4,000 years of history, with personality-driven responses, roundtable debates, and a desktop app. Runs 100% locally with Ollama for full privacy, or connects to cloud LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) for faster responses.

**[BJJ Brain](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/bjj-brain)** — Pipeline and API for turning BJJ instructional video transcripts into a structured, searchable knowledge base. 2,900+ techniques from Danaher and Gordon Ryan instructionals.

## Academic Work

My research in sleep science, NLP, and health data science lives at **[@chung-lab-miami](https://github.com/chung-lab-miami)**.
