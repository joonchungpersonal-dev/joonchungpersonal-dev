# Hey, I'm Joon

Builder, tinkerer, and lifelong learner. By day I'm a researcher at the University of Miami — by night I build things that scratch my own itch.

## What I'm Working On

**[Council of Elders](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/council-of-elders)** — A personal AI advisory board of history's greatest minds, running entirely on your computer using local AI. Ask Marcus Aurelius, Hypatia, or Rumi for advice. 101 elders spanning every inhabited continent and 4,000 years of history, with personality-driven responses, roundtable debates, and a desktop app.

**[BJJ Brain](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/bjj-brain)** — Pipeline and API for turning BJJ instructional video transcripts into a structured, searchable knowledge base. 2,900+ techniques from Danaher and Gordon Ryan instructionals.

## Academic Work

My research in sleep science, NLP, and health data science lives at **[@chung-lab-miami](https://github.com/chung-lab-miami)**.
