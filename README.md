# Hey, I'm Joon

Builder, tinkerer, and lifelong learner. By day I'm a researcher at the University of Miami — by night I build things that scratch my own itch.

## What I'm Working On

**[Council of Elders](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/council-of-elders)** — A personal AI advisory board of history's greatest minds. Ask Marcus Aurelius, Hypatia, or Rumi for advice. 101 elders spanning every inhabited continent and 4,000 years of history, with personality-driven responses, roundtable debates, and a desktop app. Runs 100% locally with Ollama for full privacy, or connects to cloud LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) for faster responses.

**[BJJ Brain](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/bjj-brain)** — Pipeline and API for turning BJJ instructional video transcripts into a structured, searchable knowledge base. 2,900+ techniques from Danaher and Gordon Ryan instructionals.

**[Veracity Audit System](https://github.com/joonchungpersonal-dev/veracity-audit-system)** — Multi-agent fact-checking system built as [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) custom skills. Decomposes documents into atomic claims ([SAFE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18802)), then verifies each through 3 waves of 5 parallel agents. Includes a [MOST](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-72206-1_1) factorial optimization experiment to determine which agents actually matter.

## Academic Work
